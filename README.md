# PedagogicalAlgorithmsInCPlusPlus
A growing list of C++ libraries that contain my solutions to algorithms that were helpful for learning C++ and programming in general.  
Where appropriate I comment functions that were written with big help from different courses or web resources.

Arrays  
Print arrays; reverse them.
Search for an element: Linear method; binary method for sorted arrays.
In an array of positive and negative numbers: Find the maximum sum of consecutive elements. 1) Brute Force 2) Prefix sum method 3) Kadane algorithm.  

Vectors  
Print vectors; find maximum/minimum of the elements; swap elements; reverse vectors.  
sort by bubble algorithm; by optimized bubble algorithm; by insertion; by counting.  
Calculate the sum of two pairs closest to a target number; calculate how many elements you can pair together with a difference less than a target, etc...
