# PedagogicalAlgorithmsInC++
A growing list of C++ libraries that contain my solutions to algorithms that are helpful for learning C++ and programming in general. The libraries also contain functions that may be useful for future research projects.  
  
Vectors  
print vectors; find maximum/minimum of the elements; swap elements; reverse vectors.  
sort by bubble algorithm; by optimized bubble algorithm; by insertion; by counting.  
Calculate the sum of two pairs closest to a target number; Calculate how many elements you can pair together with a difference less than a target, etc...
