# PedagogicalAlgorithmsInCPlusPlus
A growing list of C++ libraries that contain my solutions to algorithms that were helpful for learning C++ and programming in general.  
Where appropriate I comment functions that were written with big help from different courses or web resources.

Arrays  
Print arrays; reverse them.
Search for an element: Linear method; binary method for sorted arrays.
In an array of positive and negative numbers: Find the maximum sum of consecutive elements. 1) Brute Force 2) Prefix sum method 3) Kadane algorithm.  

Vectors  
Print vectors; find maximum/minimum of the elements; swap elements; reverse vectors.  
sort by bubble algorithm; by optimized bubble algorithm; by insertion; by counting.  
Calculate the sum of two pairs closest to a target number; calculate how many elements you can pair together with a difference less than a target, etc... 

Vectors2D
Print 2D vectors; print in spiral form; print as reverse wave.  
Check dimensionality; calculate the sum of a subportion of the 2D vector; search a sorted 2D vector.  
Create a 2D vector Pascal triangle.  
Get perimeter of a 2D vector; get specified inner loops; update 2D vectors with new perimeters/loops.  
Rotate a symmetric 2D vector by a variable amount.   
Compare cartesian points (as pair of integers); calculate distance between points; calculate distance to origin; compare distance to origin. Build a grid.  
Defense kingdom: Calculate the maximum undefended area of a variable-size chess board with a variable amount of rooks on it.
